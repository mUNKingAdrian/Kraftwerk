Coupon Acceptance Rate — Key Takeaways

Overall pattern: Acceptance is notably higher under favorable conditions and among segments with greater bar affinity and older age.

Weather effect: Decisions are usually made when it’s sunny. Clear weather correlates with a higher likelihood of accepting the coupon compared to overcast or rainy conditions.

Time pressure: Acceptance is more likely when the driver is not in a hurry. Being rushed suppresses uptake; relaxed contexts improve it.

Bar affinity & age:

Age > 25 shows higher acceptance than ≤ 25.

More frequent bar-goers (e.g., >3 visits/month) accept at higher rates than light/rare visitors (≤3/month).

Practical implications

Timing & targeting: Prioritize delivery during sunny periods and non-rush contexts (e.g., outside commute windows).

Audience focus: Emphasize offers to 25+ drivers and frequent bar-goers; consider tailored messaging or stronger incentives for younger or infrequent segments.

Experimentation: A/B test creative and timing for “not in a hurry” contexts (e.g., weekend afternoons) to validate lift.
